## **PROJECTS**

### Medieval village game scene design

### A simple medieval village game scene and a simple cutscene were created using Unreal Engine 5 and assets from the Unreal Marketplace. The scene supports ray tracing and a full sun-moon cycle system. At the same time, the new global foliage system provided by Unreal 5 is used to simulate the real foliage physics.

### Gundam 3D model scanning and modeling

Use a reality capture program to scan real life models and import them into
modeling software like maya or blender. At the same time, you can also use
Unreal 5's nanite system to directly import models into Unreal 5 for use.
