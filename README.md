## **FAQs ‚ùì**

### Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

The first is that its syntax is simple, it can be written quickly, and you can
understand all its syntax in a few minutes. Compared with the complex tags of
HTML, another markup language, Markdown is more user-friendly. Compared with the
dense buttons of Word (you must have seen many Word training tutorials), it is
faster and easier to write. The second is that it can be read directly without
the interference of various HTML tags. The syntax is simple, can be written
quickly, and can be read directly. These are the advantages of Markdown.
